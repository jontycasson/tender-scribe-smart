When reviewing code:
1. Provide specific, actionable feedback with file:line references
2. Explain WHY something is an issue, not just WHAT is wrong
3. Suggest concrete improvements
4. Prioritize: Critical > Important > Nice-to-have
5. Check for common React/TypeScript antipatterns
6. Verify Supabase queries are secure and efficient
7. Look for accessibility issues
8. Consider mobile responsiveness

Be thorough but constructive. Focus on helping improve the code.
