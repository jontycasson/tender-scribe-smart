      question: "How does the free trial work?",
      answer: "You get full access to Proposal.fit for 14 days with no credit card required. You can process up to 3 tenders during your trial to experience the full capability of our AI-powered platform."
    },
    {
      question: "What tender formats do you support?",
      answer: "We support all major document formats including PDF, Word (.docx), Excel (.xlsx), and even scanned documents. Our AI can extract questions from complex layouts, tables, and forms automatically."
    },
    {
      question: "How secure is my company data?",
      answer: "Your data security is our top priority. We're SOC2 compliant, use bank-level encryption, and process all documents within the EU. Your tender documents and responses are never used to train our AI models."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I cancel my subscription anytime?",
      answer: "Yes, you can cancel your subscription at any time with no penalties. You'll retain access to your account until the end of your billing period, and you can export all your data before canceling."
    },
    {
      question: "How accurate are the AI-generated responses?",
      answer: "Our AI achieves 95%+ accuracy on initial drafts. The responses are generated using your company profile, past successful submissions, and industry best practices. You always have full control to review and edit before submission."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you integrate with existing CRM systems?",
      answer: "CRM integrations are not currently available but are a key priority on our product roadmap. We're actively developing integrations with major platforms including Salesforce, HubSpot, and Pipedrive, with planned release in early 2025. API access for custom integrations will also be available on our Enterprise plan."
    },
    {
      question: "What support do you provide?",
      answer: "All plans include email support and access to our knowledge base. Gold and Platinum plans include priority support, and Platinum customers get a dedicated success manager plus SLA guarantees."
    },
    {
      question: "Can multiple team members collaborate on responses?",
      answer: "Absolutely! You can invite team members to your company with different permission levels. Company owners and admins can manage the team, edit company profiles, and invite new members. Regular team members have view-only access to company information but can collaborate on tender responses. This ensures your company data stays secure while enabling effective team collaboration."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I manage my account and team members?",
      answer: "Access your Account Settings from the user menu in the top right corner. Here you can update your email, change your password, edit your company profile, and manage your team. Owners and admins can add or remove team members, assign roles (admin or member), and control who has permission to edit company information."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the difference between owner, admin, and member roles?",
      answer: "Owners are the users who created the company profile and have full control. Admins can manage team members, invite new users, and edit company information. Members have view-only access to company settings but can work on tender responses. This role-based system ensures secure collaboration while maintaining data integrity."
